# Pattern-Library-Integration-Project
In this project, I integrated a p5.js library named Pattern, a separate drawing library that creates patterns, rotations, and colors for projects. 
In the script.js file contains the code to create the patterns, as well as the randomized colors that are generated.
In the index.html file, it contains the html files that allow Pattern to be integrated into the p5.js code.
